    <h2>What are "Standalone Components"?</h2>
    <p>
      Standalone components are regular Angular components with one important
      twist: They don't require a <code>@NgModule</code> as a wrapper.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instead, you can use them, well, "standalone". They define their own
      dependencies and can be imported and used anywhere.
    </p>
    <p appHighlight>
      It's also not just "standalone components", but also "standalone directives"
      and "standalone pipes".
