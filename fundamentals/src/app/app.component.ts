    Components are a key feature in Angular.
    You build your whole application by composing it from a couple of components.
    It allows you to split up your complex application, your complex webpage into reusable parts.
*/

/*
    First of all, a component is just a Typescript class.
    We export this class so that we can use this file anywhere.
      the name of the component first
      then component {}
    It's a normal TypeScript class nothing special about it.
    So we should add something to it which tells Angular that this is not only a normal TypeScript class but instead something special, a component.
    We do this by adding a special decorator.
